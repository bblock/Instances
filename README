INSTANCES

This Vala/GTK3 app demonstrates some basic functionality of a multi-tabbed, 
multi-instance application. It implements what appears to be a rudimentary text 
editor (you can't actually save any edits made to a file). Its purpose isn't 
to provide editor functionality but rather, to serve as a kind of template for 
developing applications that provide a multi-tabbed UI, the ability to launch 
multiple window instances and the ability to run from the command line.

Although I created this app in order to help increase my own understanding of 
the various concepts demonstrated, hopefully it can be of help to other Vala
developers as well.


RUNNING APP FROM THE COMMAND LINE

As a first example of running the app from the command line, you can obtain 
the app's version via the following command:

   instances --version

If you wish to open one or more document files from the command line, simply 
provide a list of files as follows:

   instances <file1.txt> <file2.txt> ...

If the app is already running, these files will be opened in it; however, 
if you preface the file list with the "new-window" switch, such files will be
opened in a NEW window instance instead:

   instances --new-window <file1.txt> <file2.txt> ...

From the command line you can also initiate the app with a new tab by issuing
the "new-tab" switch:

   instances --new-tab

To view all of the app's command line options, run the app with the "help" 
switch:

   instances --help


MAKING COMMAND LINE FUNCTIONS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE

The "new-window" switch can be referenced in the app's ".desktop" file, thereby 
enabling you to right-click on its icon shown in the desktop's dock and choose 
"new window". This can be done by simply adding the following to the bottom of 
the app's ".desktop" file: 

   Actions=new-window;

   [Desktop Action new-window]
   Name=New Window
   Exec=instances --new-window
